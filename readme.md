# Github Organisation Explorer
> This is a real-time version of the [server-side Github organisation explorer](https://github.com/vandijkstef/performance-matters-server-side).

This app can be linked to a GitHub organisation to explore information about it. View the repositories and forks within that organisation. This was created as part of the Webdevelopment Minor at CMD Amsterdam.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
This project assumes you are familiar with NodeJS (`9.11.1`) and NPM (`5.6.0`), and have those installed. Also, MongoDB (`3.6.4`) is assumed to be installed. Client side you would need a browser that supports `JS ES6 Modules` and `WebSocket`.

### Code style
All JS should conform to the eslint config thats included. Please make sure ESlint is functional in your code editor and the supplied config is being used.

### Installation and running
After cloning the project, install using:
```
npm install
```

The app currently requires no building.

Before starting the application, make sure MongoDB is started:
```
npm run mongo
```

Aftwards, start the app using:
```
npm start
```
Additionally, you can also watch the app using Nodemon:
```
npm run watch
```
